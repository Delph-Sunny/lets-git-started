# Let's 'Git' Started

## Synopsis

This is a study group to learn Git and how to effectively use git within a team based environment.

In this group you will learn how to use the command-line version of Git. Including but not limited to:
 
 - configuring git
 - pushing
 - pulling
 - cloning
 - forking
 - branching
 - merging
 - re-basing
 - fetching

and more...

Of course, we wont be covering all of these topics in the span of 2 hours, but over the span of multiple study groups.

## Instructions

Be sure to Fork this repository before heading into the study group! If you haven't done this yet, don't worry we can go over it in the study group.

## Creating a Fork
Just head over to the GitHub page and click the "Fork" button. It's just that simple. Once you've done that, you can use your favorite git client to clone your repo but I suggest using the command line as that is the whole point of this study group:

```shell
# Clone your fork to your local machine
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/FORKED-PROJECT.git
```

## Keeping Your Fork Up-To-Date
We will go over this in the study group, but you can read [this document][up-to-date] to get a head start.
